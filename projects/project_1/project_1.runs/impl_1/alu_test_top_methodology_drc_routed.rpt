LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell display/digit[0]_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) display/count_reg[0]/CLR, display/count_reg[10]/CLR, display/count_reg[11]/CLR, display/count_reg[12]/CLR, display/count_reg[13]/CLR, display/count_reg[14]/CLR, display/count_reg[15]/CLR, display/count_reg[16]/CLR, display/count_reg[17]/CLR, display/count_reg[18]/CLR, display/count_reg[1]/CLR, display/count_reg[2]/CLR, display/count_reg[3]/CLR, display/count_reg[4]/CLR, display/count_reg[5]/CLR (the first 15 of 19 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
